# Note-taker

## Description

People from all professions have various commitments and tasks to attend to throughout the week. It is easy to forget what you were set out to do. Having a note-taker that reminds you of your various commitments comes in handy. Through buidling this project, I learned setting routes for the server API, as well as fetching the data from client side.
